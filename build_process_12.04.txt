# Ramblings on setting the keyboard to be GB by default.

In /usr/lib/ubiquity/ubiquity/misc.py is the thing that kicks in if you change the language in the original greeter.
It has a hard-coded list, but I suspect this never gets activated.  Wrong!  It does.  And in fact if I run (on live boot):

ubiquity -g --only

It resets the libgnomekbg indicator.  Right - I think we may be close to nailing this!!
In fact, if I boot vanilla Ubuntu, select the GB keyboard, and run ubiquity as above it puts the
US keyboard back.  So there is no clever system - it's an orrible ack. So time to hack back.

My solution - in misc.py, if us is keyboard 1 and gb is 3, swap them around.
This will be overwritten if Ubiquity updates, but I'm not sure what to do about that.
Just leaving the file with the edit in for now.  I've made it so the recon script checks
if the edit is still in place.

See fux_misc_py.patch.  Remember to re-patch if Ubiquity is updated.
