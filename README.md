Bio-Linux Image Build Scripts
=============================

Bio-Linux is a project to make Linux systems for biological scientists.

http://environmentalomics.org/bio-linux

There are various threads to the project, but the headline product is the
Bio-Linux ISO image which can be used to make a bootable DVD or a USB stick.

If you wanted to recreate the ISO yourself, here are the files you need.
Note that the process is mostly automated but not fully automated, and the
material here is not intended for end users so don't expect it all to just
work.
See ./build_process_14.04.txt

If you want to also make the OVA version of Bio-Linux you first need the ISO file
and then see the environmentalomics/iso-to-image repository on GitHub for the
next bit.
