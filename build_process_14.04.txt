New and shiny build notes for BL8.  Yay.  I'm not yet moving to a full auto-build
mode as some things just don't fit.  However I am trying to push as much as possible
into packages.  It it won't package I'll at least have a test in recon.test.d to spot
if the fix needs reapplying.

Things that won't package are:

Build process - as before, it's broadly:

1) Set up the build machine and unpack the ISO
2) Log into the ISO and make some changes
3) Install the master package list, as used by the upgrade8.sh script
4) Install a couple of extra things just for the ISO
5) Remaster and publish
6) Auto-build the .ova (with Packer)

1))) Initial unpacking.

Ensure the machine is running Ubuntu 14.04

#Check the actual latest ISO at http://releases.ubuntu.com/trusty as the auto-download
#URL no longer works
wget -c http://releases.ubuntu.com/trusty/ubuntu-14.04-desktop-amd64.iso

mkdir reconstructor_bl7 && cd !#1
mkdir initrd remaster root original_cd_image

sudo mkdir /mnt/cdrom1
sudo mount -t auto -o loop ~/ubuntu-14.04*-desktop-amd64.iso /mnt/cdrom1

rsync -av /mnt/cdrom1/ ./remaster/
chmod -R u+w remaster
 
rsync -av /mnt/cdrom1/ ./original_cd_image/
chmod -R a-w original_cd_image
 
sudo umount /mnt/cdrom
# Skip unpacking the initrd for now, as it just gets recreated by recon anyway.

# Unpack root fs
cd ./root
mkdir ../squashmount
sudo mount -t squashfs -o loop,ro ../remaster/casper/filesystem.squashfs ../squashmount/
sudo rsync -av ../squashmount/ .
sudo umount ../squashmount
rmdir ../squashmount

2))) Non-packaged customisations

# Everything here should be at least checked by recon.test.d, and ideally fixed automagically.
# As of 22/7, this should be done, so see the notes here and skip to 3

# Openchroot now works (assuming you fixed the reconstructor symlink).  Yay.
# Review biolinuxfirstboot...
sudo cp ~/bl8bits/biolinuxfirstboot ~/reconstructor/root/etc/init.d/
for rc in 1 2 ; sudo ln -s ../init.d/biolinuxfirstboot ~/reconstructor/root/etc/rc${rc}.d/S99biolinuxfirstboot
# Note this is checked by recon.test.d but not auto-fixed.

# Rebrand both the isolinux and Grub menus
# Added this to recon.test.d.

# Add root .profile?  Yes, but a red root prompt should also be set in bio-linux-zsh.
# Added this to recon.test.d.  Note the image comes with .profile and .bashrc already in /root
# and not owned by a package so it makes sense to edit these.

# Now openchroot.  At a minimum I need to add the BL repo and the themes_v8 package, but I should be
# able to do this with my upgrade_to_8 script.

3))) Packages

# First do a regular dist-upgrade.
openchroot
 apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade
(as this updates the kernel we also get a new initrd!)

# The Kernel fails to install.  Why?  Because Grub was updated and restored /usr/sbin/update_grub.
# No probs - just drop out of chroot and back in, and retry.

# activate the universe and multiverse
#(software-properties-gtk no good in chroot)
sudo tee ~/reconstructor/root/etc/apt/sources.list < ~/bl8bits/sources.list 

# Then:
wget -q -P ~/reconstructor/root/tmp http://nebc.nerc.ac.uk/downloads/bl8_only/upgrade8.sh \
  && openchroot <<<'sh /tmp/upgrade8.sh'


# Yep, amazingly that worked.  /proc is busy so reboot before remastering
# also...
apt-get install bio-linux-fixups

# and purge the old 0-24 kernel
dpkg -P ...

4))) Building the ISO

# Now run recon to activate all the fixes and see where we are at.
~/bin/recon 8.0.0

# Eek - too big!  Removed geneious, predictprotein and isacreator
# and aisleriot.  Also ensured we use the recon.efi by default.
# And added mlocate update on rebuild, and fixed removal of /etc/resolv.conf

And we're looking pretty good...
